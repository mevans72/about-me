    <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>I currently live in the great city of Seattle in Washingington state, but would also love to live in either Honolulu or San Diego. I have a background of over thirteen years as a leader in information security, and have a combination of experience in both business and technology, but the one major thing I am missing is a DEV background.
